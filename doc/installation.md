## Prerequisite

To install go, please follow [the official documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install). It is recommended to have Go 1.19 or higher installed for building and installing client software.

After installing go, you need to set the environment variables $GOPATH, $GOBIN, and $PATH:

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/go/bin
echo "export GOPATH=$HOME/go" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
echo "export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
echo "export PATH=$PATH:$GOBIN" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

To verify that go has been installed successfully on your system, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go version
```

In addition, before installing any software that depends on libraries provided by Google, you should make sure that your server can access `google.com`. If you are not able to access `google.com`, you can try adding a proxy by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
echo "export GOPROXY=https://goproxy.io" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Install dependencies
```
sudo apt install curl build-essential git wget jq make gcc tmux chrony -y
```
